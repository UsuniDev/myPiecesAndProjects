                    Last month was good. I'm currently trying to fix my schedule and understand Twitter's algorithm. <br> I still don't want to go back to drawing Nidoran.
                    I tried to be more sociable, but it seems I'm not very good at it; people are busy with their own lives too. <br>
                    I hope I don't mess things up when talking. I usually bite my tongue, but I fear I might snap at some point. <br><br>

                    Anyway, it was a good year. I hope I get to kiss a boy :3c <br>
                    Merry Christmas, and God bless you. <br>

                <h2>November 2025</h3>
                <h4>description: Good so far.</h2>
                
                <div style="padding: 20px;"><br>
                    Well, as far as I see it seems most of my concerns are calmed by now.
                    I made the main  <a href="https://x.com/ARMITAGER6/">account</a> on twitter along with
                    the drive folders, and of course this webpage. <br><br>
                    This is a late letter for this month, but I think I still needed to write it.
                    I expect to do two more fan art for artists I like, and after that I will resume my work
                    at the pokemon project where I still need to draw <a href="https://www.wikidex.net/wiki/Nidoran%E2%99%82">Nidoran♂</a>, 
                    but, to be honest, I have come to hate this little monster. I also expect to add 
                    "Terms of Service" to this page for some future projects <br><br>

                    November has been quite interesting and while nobody knows me I can mess with my art 
                    and projects a lot and I believe I have gained "reputation" and visibility <br><br>

                    This monthly letters are only made to share my views and expectations, it is not that deep
                    but, I will try to make one monthly <br>

                    bueno,감사합니다,またね,Adeus. <br>
